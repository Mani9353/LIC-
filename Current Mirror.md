# **Current Mirror Experiment**

Aim : Design and Analyze Current mirror circuit as active load in amplifier circuit.

## Introduction
A current mirror is a circuit designed to copy (mirror) a reference current from one branch of the circuit to another, ensuring that the output current remains constant regardless of voltage variations. This is essential for maintaining stable operation in analog circuits, particularly in integrated circuits (ICs).

## Theory
The basic principle of a current mirror involves using two or more transistors where one transistor is configured to set the reference current, and the other(s) mirror this current. The transistors are typically matched to ensure accurate current replication.


## Advantages of Current Mirrors:
* **Stable Biasing**: Provides consistent and accurate bias currents
* **Improved Performance**: Enhances gain, stability, and bandwidth of amplifiers
* **Power Efficiency**: Reduces power consumption compared to resistor biasing
* **Temperature Compensation**: Ensures reliable operation over a wide temperature range
* **Scalability**: Easily scalable to multiple output branches

## Effect of Current Mirrors:
* **Gain**: Improves amplifier gain
* **Stability**: Reduces variations in bias current
* **Bandwidth**: Enhances frequency response
* **Noise Reduction**: Maintains a low noise floor
* **Load Regulation**: Ensures consistent performance under varying load conditions
